## About
Hi, I'm Nicolas from Colombia. I'm a Photographer but also passionate about constant learning and new challenges. Therefore, I decided in 2022 to change my career path as photography wasn't fulfilling my expectations. I needed something more challenging that made me use my brain and push the boundaries. That's when programming came to my mind and its already been a year since then.
